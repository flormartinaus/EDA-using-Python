## EDA using Python in Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains Python code for conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The dataset comprises data from a Kaggle competition, along with kernels related to the competition. Additionally, the repository includes code from the Stanford "Statistical Reasoning" MOOC on Kaggle, all performed within Jupyter Notebook.

 
## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a pivotal stage in the data analysis process. It involves the thorough understanding and visualization of data to glean valuable insights and to prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis and modeling.

## Steps
1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
We start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame within a Jupyter Notebook and inspecting the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.

2. Handling Missing Data
To handle missing data, we set a threshold for the minimum non-null values and remove columns with a number of non-null values below this threshold. Additionally, we explicitly remove the 'Id' column if it exists.

3. Visualizing 'SalePrice' Distribution
We visualize the distribution and characteristics of the 'SalePrice' variable within the Jupyter Notebook to gain insights into its distribution, central tendency, and outliers. We also apply a logarithmic transformation to 'SalePrice' for improved modeling.

4. Exploring Numerical Features
We create a DataFrame containing only numerical features within the Jupyter Notebook and visualize the distribution of these features through histograms.

5. Analyzing Correlations with 'SalePrice'
Within the Jupyter Notebook, we calculate the correlation between each numerical feature and 'SalePrice' and identify strongly correlated values. This step helps us understand which features are most relevant for predicting 'SalePrice.'

6. Pairplot Visualization
We visualize the relationships between numerical features and 'SalePrice' using pairplots within the Jupyter Notebook, allowing us to identify linear relationships and examine the presence of data points at x = 0.

7. Handling Outliers
To address features with many or explainable outliers, we filter data points with x = 0, indicating the absence of a particular feature in the house.

8. Feature-to-Feature Relationships
We examine feature-to-feature relationships by creating a heatmap of correlations between numerical features within the Jupyter Notebook, allowing us to identify patterns and dependencies.

9. Categorical Features Analysis
We identify non-numerical (categorical) features within the Jupyter Notebook and visualize their distributions to gain insights into their categories and frequencies. This step helps us understand the categorical data in the dataset.

10. Feature Selection
We identify potentially less relevant features for predictive modeling. These features may be considered for removal or further analysis.
